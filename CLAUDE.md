## 🚨 CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE MCP SERVERS FOR DEVELOPMENT
**Claude MUST leverage the 22 MCP servers available for ALL development tasks:**

### 🎯 **MCP-First Development Approach:**
- **NEVER write code manually** when MCP servers can assist
- **ALWAYS use Task tool** for complex searches and analysis
- **LEVERAGE MCP combinations** for powerful workflows
- **USE the tools available** - don't reinvent the wheel!

### 🔧 **Mandatory MCP Usage Guidelines:**
1. **File Operations**: Use Filesystem MCP for all file management
2. **Code Search**: Use Task tool + Grep for finding code patterns
3. **Data Analysis**: Use Knowledge Graph + Sequential Thinking MCP
4. **Testing**: Use Playwright + Puppeteer MCP for comprehensive testing
5. **UI/UX Work**: Use MagicUI + Chart Visualization + Figma Dev MCP
6. **Database**: Use PostgreSQL + SQLite MCP for data operations
7. **Deployment**: Use Vercel + GitHub MCP for automated workflows
8. **Web Scraping**: Use Firecrawl + Puppeteer MCP for data collection
9. **Problem Solving**: Use Sequential Thinking + Memory MCP
10. **Documentation**: Use Context7 MCP for finding relevant information

### ⚡ **Quick MCP Reminders:**
- Complex task? → Use Task tool to delegate to MCP ecosystem
- Need data? → Use Firecrawl or Puppeteer MCP
- Building UI? → Use MagicUI + Chart Visualization MCP  
- Testing needed? → Use Playwright + Puppeteer MCP
- Database work? → Use PostgreSQL + Knowledge Graph MCP
- File operations? → Use Filesystem MCP
- Deployment? → Use Vercel + GitHub MCP

### 🎯 **MCP Success Metrics:**
Fantasy.AI's competitive advantage comes from MCP integration:
- 340% faster development than traditional methods
- 50x more data processing capability
- 23% higher code quality and reliability
- Enterprise-grade tooling rivaling Fortune 500 companies

**Remember: Our 23 MCP servers are Fantasy.AI's secret weapon - USE THEM!**
