# üîç DEBUG: Why Database Connection Isn't Working

## The Issue:
Your app keeps trying to connect to the POOLER URL even though you've updated it in Vercel.

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Environment Variable Not Applied to All Environments
- Go to: https://vercel.com/justinrstone81-gmailcoms-projects/fantasy-ai-mvp/settings/environment-variables
- Click on `DATABASE_URL`
- Make sure ALL checkboxes are checked:
  - ‚úÖ Production
  - ‚úÖ Preview  
  - ‚úÖ Development

### 2. Old Build Cache Being Used
- When redeploying, make sure to:
  - UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"
  - This forces a completely fresh build

### 3. Prisma Client Needs Regeneration
The Prisma client might be cached with the old connection string.

## SOLUTION: Add Direct Connection Override

1. Go to Vercel Environment Variables
2. Add a NEW variable:
   ```
   Name: DIRECT_DATABASE_URL
   Value: postgresql://postgres.jhfhsbqrdblytrlrconc:3O4X69OIECpNNjoW@db.jhfhsbqrdblytrlrconc.supabase.co:5432/postgres
   ```
3. Enable for: Production ‚úÖ Preview ‚úÖ Development ‚úÖ
4. Save

Then we'll update the code to use this for now.

## Quick Test:
After adding DIRECT_DATABASE_URL and redeploying, check:
https://fantasy-ai-mvp.vercel.app/api/debug/player-count

This should finally connect to your 5,040 players!
