## Why These Features Were Archived

### Production Readiness
Many features were experimental proof-of-concepts requiring significant additional development before production deployment.

### Technology Maturity
Some features depend on technologies not yet widely available (Neuralink, quantum computing, interplanetary communication).

### Regulatory Considerations
Gambling and wagering features require careful legal compliance and licensing.

### Market Timing
Advanced features like AR/VR and crypto integration may be better suited for future product phases.

### Focus & Prioritization
To achieve production readiness, we focused on core fantasy sports functionality rather than experimental features.
