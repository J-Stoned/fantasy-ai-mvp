🚨 I built a voice assistant that works on ANY website - just say "Hey Fantasy"

After months of development, I've created something that completely changes how we get sports data online.

Just say "Hey Fantasy" on ANY website (ESPN, Twitter, anywhere) and get:
• Instant player stats & projections
• Fantasy start/sit advice
• Live injury reports
• Game scores & updates

It's 100% free and works everywhere. No more switching tabs or apps.

This is exactly what I wished existed as a fantasy manager. Would love feedback from this amazing community!

🎤 Voice-activated sports data on ANY website - game changer for research

Fellow degenerates, I built something that might save us all some time.

Say "Hey Fantasy" on any website and get instant:
• Player props & injury status
• Team stats & matchups  
• Live scores during games
• Research data without leaving your current page

Works on Twitter, news sites, anywhere you browse while researching bets.

Anyone else think voice commands are the future of sports research?

```
This browser extension lets you get NFL stats on ANY website with voice commands

Just discovered this is possible - you can now say "Hey Fantasy, what's Mahomes' stats?" on literally any website and get instant data.

Works on:
• Social media while arguing with friends
• News sites for fact-checking
• Any webpage when you need quick stats

It's like having NFL.com built into every website you visit.

Pretty mind-blowing that this tech exists now. What other voice commands would you want?

2/ Why this matters:

You're reading ESPN → need injury update → say "Hey Fantasy, is CMC playing?"
You're on Twitter → see trade rumor → say "Hey Fantasy, show me his stats"  
You're anywhere online → need sports data → just TALK to get it

No more tab switching. No more app opening.
```

```
3/ The technology:

✅ Works on 100% of websites
✅ Real-time sports data  
✅ AI-powered fantasy advice
✅ Voice recognition optimized for sports terms

This is the future of sports interaction.

Hey Matthew,

Huge fan of your work! I built something I think you and fantasy managers everywhere will love.

It's a browser extension that lets you say "Hey Fantasy" on ANY website (including ESPN.com) and get instant player stats, fantasy advice, and injury updates.

No more switching tabs. No more typing player names. Just voice commands that work everywhere online.

Would love to send you early access to try it out. I think it could be a game-changer for how fantasy managers research players.
