Hi Matthew,

Huge fan of your work! Been following your analysis for years and you've made me a much better fantasy player.

I've spent the last 6 months building something I think you'd find interesting - a voice assistant trained on expert analysis (including yours) that gives instant fantasy advice anywhere online.

Instead of typing player names or switching apps, users just say "Hey Fantasy" on any website and get AI-powered insights. The system has learned from thousands of hours of your podcasts, articles, and analysis.

Would love to show you a quick 2-minute demo. I think you'd appreciate how it democratizes expert analysis and makes fantasy research effortless.

No ask for endorsement or anything - just excited to show a fellow fantasy obsessive what we've built.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The AI actually quotes your "start your studs" philosophy when users ask about obvious lineup decisions!

### **Adam Schefter Email:**
**Subject:** Adam - Revolutionary sports voice tech (2-minute demo?)

```
Hi Adam,

Been following your breaking news coverage for years - you've revolutionized how fast sports information travels.

I built something that might interest you as someone who understands the value of instant sports information access.

It's a voice assistant that works on ANY website - users can say "Hey Fantasy" while browsing Twitter, ESPN, anywhere, and get instant player stats, injury updates, and analysis.

The AI has learned from your reporting style and actually references your breaking news when users ask about player status.

Would love to show you a quick demo of how we're making sports information even more accessible. Takes 2 minutes and I think you'd appreciate the innovation.

No agenda beyond sharing something cool with someone who gets sports tech.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. The system can actually detect when you break news and instantly updates player information based on your reports!
